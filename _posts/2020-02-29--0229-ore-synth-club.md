ORE SYNTHESIZER CLUB in association with
ORE VILLAGE AERONAUTICAL AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION
present THE 1969 MOON LANDING SHOW

Throughout the 1960s, NASA spent billions of dollars on the US space programme. In July 1969, Apollo 11 flew to the moon and Neil Armstrong made history when he took his One Giant Leap For Mankind. But was he, in fact, the first man to set foot on the lunar surface?

After extensive research in recently discovered archives, Ore Synthesizer Club – the premier exponents of electronic music in the north-east Hastings (and Fairlight borders) area – bring to the Printers Playhouse their acclaimed interpretation of the 1969 Moon Landings. With their films, animations and live soundtrack played on analogue synthesizers, OSC members Alun Allen, Arturo Bax and Nigel Noveaux will take you out of Eastbourne and out of this world.

In The Playhouse. 7.30pm (Doors 5pm)

Tickets £10
