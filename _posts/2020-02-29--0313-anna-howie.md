London born singer-songwriter Anna writes songs with a positive take on life and love, friendship and courage. She has worked as a session singer on live Radio 2 sessions with Brian May and Kerry Ellis and appeared on several albums. Anna was half of the Sirens which took her all over Europe. In her own words: “I’ve been treated like a queen and a nobody. I have put my black dress on in fancy dressing rooms and public toilets - l have laughed and cried, gone down a storm and totally bombed - it has been a rollercoaster...” Come down to Printers to join her..!
