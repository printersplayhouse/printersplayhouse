John Hackett is known for his distinctive flute sound in the world of progressive music and as an accomplished soloist.

The release of the rock album Another Life (on Esoteric Antenna) in 2015 was the catalyst to forming the new John Hackett Band with Nick Fletcher (guitars), Jeremy Richardson (bass, guitars & vocals) and Duncan Parsons (drums) in 2016.
