Folk-fusion band Lost Revellers play original compositions and creative arrangements of world folk and jazz tunes, drawing on Gypsy jazz, tango, Celtic and Eastern-European folk music and classical repertoire. Performed on violin, accordion, drums/percussion and bass, Lost Revellers' live set combines a high octane performance, masterful musicianship and musical creativity.   

Since the launch of their debut ep in April 2017 , Lost Revellers have played gigs in venues from Dorset to Edinburgh, and festivals including Camp Bestival, Bridport Folk Festival and Sandwich Folk and Ale Festival. After a tour in Germany in October 2018 they recorded  their debut album 'Midnight Circus', released in March 2019.

Their music has been played on BBC Radio 3 and regional BBC radio shows, and their arrangement of the 1st movement of the Bach Double Violin Concerto In D Minor ('Vivace/Daphne') features on the soundtrack of an award winning Italian feature film screened at film festivals worldwide, and on Italian national television.
