Harry Crumb is renowned all around the world for his artistic genius- and then he wakes up and spends his days cleaning toilets for his bullying employer. Desperate to change his life, Harry convinces a world famous art dealer that a random drawing by his nephew is actually a great piece of modern art. Very soon, Harry has everything he ever wanted, fame, fortune and international recognition. But when a mysterious artist starts and Russian gangsters start to express an interest in his work, Harry finds his life being turned upside down. Will he tell the truth in the end?
