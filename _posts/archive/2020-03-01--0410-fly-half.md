A new play by Gary Lagden.

The story of a rugby playing steel worker from South Wales. A lyrical hymn to one man’s passion for his family, his town and his beloved game of rugby. Set in an industrial town, this is a celebration of working class families who head out to the game each week, supporting their local team. Fly Half is a story of love, loss, community and sport that rages against the beige of modern life.
