The band formerly known as 40 Shillings On The Drum, and firm favourites at PPH, rise phoenix-like in a new and improved form! Just as frantic as ever, to set your blood racing, and fresh from newly winning the new Bond film theme song(!), they are truly poised for great things. You will be able to say you saw them first at this great little venue in Eastbourne!
