The Bangkok Rules by John Berry

Women are a minority group in prisons across the world. As a result, women’s gender-specific characteristics and subsequent needs are rarely taken into account in a system that was created for men.

The UN Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners more commonly referred to as the Bangkok Rules, were unanimously voted for by the UN General Assembly. The Rules thus provide a monitoring mechanism and good practice guidelines to which member states have chosen to adhere. This is the story of four woman stuck in this system.
