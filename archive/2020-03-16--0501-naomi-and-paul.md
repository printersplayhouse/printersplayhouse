Naomi Bedford is an award winning English folk singer from Brighton who works with partner Paul Simmonds, songwriter and guitarist with The Men They Couldn’t Hang. Her debut album, ‘Tales From the Weeping Willow – Songs of Murder, Death and Sorrow’, was released to wide acclaim in 2011 and featured collaborations with Paul Heaton, Alasdair Roberts and Justin Currie. 

Her follow up album, ‘A History of Insolence’, was released in 2014 and featured a variety of material celebrating dissent in all its forms. Once again the reviews were uniformly excellent and the album featured in the ‘Best Of’ Year lists in both the Guardian and Mojo magazine. They were nominated for a BBC Radio 2 Folk Award in 2015.

In the last year Naomi and Paul released ‘Singing It All Back Home’ scoring a Guardian Folk Album of the month and Mark Radcliffe Radio 2 session. They have appeared at Glastonbury Festival, Celtic Connections, Cecil Sharp House and have been invited for a Bob Harris session in 2020.
