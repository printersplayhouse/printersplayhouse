## Event Postponed

Sensational local cover band take to the stage at 9pm for their summer warm-up gig, playing more than 2 hours of live music. This event will be recorded on video.

Support from Deano and the Danglers.

Not exactly new in personnel, but certainly the first real public exposure of a fine new rock band. The Great Fire is the project of John and Stacey Hollobone who, as everyone knows, are stalwart of the Printers Playhouse musical network! Expect fabulous vocals and scintillating guitar and a host of originals and interpretations from a band going far!
