He grew up in Co. Cork on the West coast of Ireland. His musical influence meanders through Irish, Malian and Hawaiian folk to the pre-war blues of Chicago along The Delta and down through the lyrical landscape of Dylan, Mitchell and Young. Music from his debut album 'THE HERMIT'S WALTZ' (2012) make up the soundtrack to the independent feature film, 'The Hour of Living' in which Pepe also appears as 'The Singer'. \nA near fatal bicycle accident in 2011 slowed plans for touring and releasing new material. Throughout this imposed hiatus, Pepe continued to work; writing and recording his second full band studio album, 'What Once Was'; publishing a small book, 'Poems/ Prose/ Pictures'; written and performed music for the acclaimed independent feature, 'O' Beautiful Night'; released 2 live albums including 'Live at The Royal Albert Hall' and 'Live at the Jenny'; and has performed live sporadically both solo and with a full band. He is currently recording his third studio album. ","excerpt":"Tickets £8.00 (plus booking fee).\n\nBook tickets through Online Ticket Seller, or in venue.
