Saturday 20th November.  8 pm.  In The Playhouse.  Tickets £8 \nSupported by Hayley Savage\n\nBBC Folk Award Winner Ben Walker joins forces with highly acclaimed singer and pianist Kirsty Merryn to create a fresh take on a tradition ripe for rediscovery...\n\n\"Life and the Land\" is a celebration of England's harvest tradition, re-imagining songs born out of our agricultural past.\n\nBen Walker was recently hailed as 'one of the best acoustic guitarists in the world right now' (Total Guitar magazine) and 'a great guitarist composer and producer' (Mark Radcliffe, BBC Folk Show).  With his work sought out from punk to Proms, from Rough Trade to the Royal Shakespeare Company, his passion is putting old jewels into new settings.  He has been involved in over 50 albums as performer and producer, and his new solo LP 'Echos' has received universal critical acclaim. \n\nKirsty Merryn launched her debut album 'She and I' in 2017 whilst supporting folk behemoths Show of Hands on their UK cathedrals tour.  Her follow-up 'Our Bright Night' was chosen by The Guardian as their Folk Album of the Month.","excerpt":"19:30pm, £8","date":"2021-11-20T20:00:00.000Z","publish":true,"feature":true,"category":"music","image":[{"id":"attfTvSOHGitC9tug","width":1400,"height":520,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/afab4486b16eb95014a15d703ea001ee/36e2d66c/242652583_4387015811334235_3792224013305536142_n.jpg","filename":"242652583_4387015811334235_3792224013305536142_n.jpg","size":69752,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a208c72cdc8c099758bdac264da99948/522f0ec2","width":97,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/04f971480ef8dbfaa9fbe3768deb18ed/d9030731","width":1378,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/150071b350dca7306c68387d718b5be6/8e79a47a","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"ticketlink":"https://onlineticketseller.com/events/?id=4178&event=troubadoursbenwalkerandkirstymerryn"},"createdTime":"2021-11-02T15:59:50.000Z"},{"id":"rec0p6CwA9zpo8BWF","fields":{"title":"Play Reading Workshops","content":"£60 per course £10 per session.\nStarts Monday September 20th 1-3pm \n\n6 week script reading course, 2 hour workshop each week reading a full script. \nLooking at the things we did/didn’t like, giving feedback on the project. \n\nEmail us to book: info@printersplayhouse.co.uk","excerpt":"£60 per course £10 per session.\nJan 10th to Feb 14th\nMondays 1-3pm ","date":"2022-01-10T13:00:00.000Z","publish":true,"feature":true,"category":"workshops","image":[{"id":"attNsmtMtN0iRhST1","width":1080,"height":1080,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/6a2095c215188e1fecdf0a7ab9f7a23f/43d5205e/Untitleddesign2.png","filename":"Untitled design (2).png","size":1423938,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4e7d1e876e0db6f911a81bb69eef2b55/7f977a5b","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a8988e544033fb76e6e4648edc722214/c540f71e","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/dab14ea8ab516ef402bd4188cd08b550/765cc858","width":3000,"height":3000}}}]},"createdTime":"2021-11-02T14:52:05.000Z"},{"id":"rec0srpFLi7g0s8h4","fields":{"title":"Room To Rant","content":"Room to Rant is a space for young men to rap and get stuff off their chest.\n\nThe rap and spoken word initiative that tackles men’s mental health is in action across Brighton, Worthing, Crawley, Eastbourne and online. \n\nThe rap sessions are led by highly-experienced and accomplished rappers who are well respected in the  Brighton hip-hop and music scene.
