    <p>A chance for performers to work on and perform monologues and songs to industry standard. 8 actors with 3 two minute pieces working with PPH professional directors to culminate in a showcase performance.</p>
    <p>8 actors. 3, 2 min monologues combining for an hour long performance in the Playhouse.</p>
    <p>Every third Friday of every other month!</p>
    <p>We are already building a great network of artists and musicians locally and nationally, but are always on the lookout for new talent to showcase; either downstairs or in joint promotions upstairs in the theatre. Let us know about you by emailing chris@printersplayhouse.co.uk – and it could be the beginning of a glittering career, or at least a lovely gig at Printers Playhouse!</p>
